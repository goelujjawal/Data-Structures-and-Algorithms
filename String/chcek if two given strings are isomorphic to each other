Problem :

Given two strings 'str1' and 'str2', check if these two strings are isomorphic to each other.
Two strings str1 and str2 are called isomorphicif there is a one to one mapping possible for every char of str1 to every character of str2 while preserving the order.
Note: All occurrences of every character in str1 should map to the same character in str2

Example 1:

Input:
str1 = aab
str2 = xxy
Output: 1
Explanation: There are two different charactersin aab and xxy, i.e a and b with frequency 2and 1 respectively.

Example 2:
Input:
str1 = aab
str2 = xyz
Output: 0
Explanation: There are two different charactersin aab but there are three different charactersin xyz. So there won't be one to one mapping between str1 and str2.


Solution :

str1=input()
str2=input()
s1=set(str1)
s2=set(str2)
l1=[]
l2=[]
for i in range(0,len(s1)):
    l1.append(str1.count(str1[i]))
for i in range(0,len(s2)):
    l2.append(str2.count(str2[i]))
    if l1==l2:
        print("1")
    else:
        print("0")
