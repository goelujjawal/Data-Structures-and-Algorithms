Problem :

Consider a sample space S consisting of all perfect squares starting from 1, 4, 9 and so on.
You are given a number N, you have to output the number of integers less than N in the sample space S.

Example 1:
Input :
N = 9
Output:
2
Explanation:
1 and 4 are the only Perfect Squares
less than 9. So, the Output is 2.

Example 2 :
Input :
N = 3
Output:
1
Explanation:
1 is the only Perfect Square
less than 3. So, the Output is 1.
 
 
 Solution :
 
n=int(input())
def count_square(n):
    start=0
    end=n-1
    mid=start+((end-start)//2)
    while start<=end:
        if mid*mid>n:
            end=mid-1
        if mid*mid<n:
            ans=mid
            start=mid+1
        if mid*mid==n:
            return mid-1
        mid=start+((end-start)//2)
    return ans
print(count_square(n))
