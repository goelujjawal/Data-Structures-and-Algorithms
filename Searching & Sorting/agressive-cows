Problem :

Farmer John has built a new long barn, with N (2 <= N <= 100,000) stalls.
The stalls are located along a straight line at positions x1,...,xN (0 <= xi <= 1,000,000,000).
His C (2 <= C <= N) cows don't like this barn layout and become aggressive towards each other once put into a stall.
To prevent the cows from hurting each other, FJ wants to assign the cows to the stalls, such that the minimum distance between any two of them is as large as possible
What is the largest minimum distance?

Example :
Input :
n=4
arr=4,2,1,3,6
k=2
Output:
5


Solution :

n=int(input())
arr=list(map(int,input().split())
k=int(input())
def isPossible(arr,k,mid):
    cowCount=1
    pos=arr[0]
    for i in range(0,len(arr)):
        if arr[i]-pos>=mid:
            cowCount+=1
            if cowCount==k:
                return True
            pos=arr[i]
    return False
            
def aggressive_cows(arr,m):
    arr.sort()
    start=0
    end=max(arr)-min(arr)
    mid=start+((end-start)//2)
    ans=-1
    while start<=end:
        if isPossible(arr,k,mid):
            ans=mid
            start=mid+1
        else:
            end=mid-1
        mid=start+((end-start)//2)
    return ans
            
print(aggressive_cows(arr,k))
