Problem :

Given elements as nodes of the two linked lists. The task is to multiply these two linked lists, say L1 and L2. 

Note: The output could be large take modulo 109+7.

Input:
The first line of input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases.
Then T test cases follow, the first line of each test case contains an integer N denoting the size of the first linked list (L1).
In the next line are the space separated values of the first linked list.
The third line of each test case contains an integer M denoting the size of the second linked list (L2). 
In the forth line are space separated values of the second linked list.

Output:
For each test case output will be an integer denoting the product of the two linked list.

Example:
Input:
2
2
3 2
1
2
3
1 0 0
2
1 0 

Output:
64
1000

Explanation:
Testcase 1: 32*2 = 64.
Testcase 2: 100*10 = 1000.


Solution :
def multiplyTwoList(head1, head2):
    # Code here
    s1=0
    temp=head1
    while temp!=None:
        s1=(s1*10)+temp.data
        temp=temp.next
    s2=0
    temp2=head2
    while temp2!=None:
        s2=(s2*10)+temp2.data
        temp2=temp2.next
    return (s1*s2)%MOD
