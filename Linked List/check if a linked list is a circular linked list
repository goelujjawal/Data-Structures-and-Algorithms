Problem :

Given head, the head of a singly linked list, find if the linked list is circular or not.
A linked list is called circular if it not NULL terminated and all nodes are connected in the form of a cycle. An empty linked list is considered as circular.
Note: The linked list does not contains any inner loop.

Example 1:
Input:
LinkedList: 1->2->3->4->5
(the first and last node is connected,
i.e. 5 --> 1)
Output: 1

Example 2:
Input:
LinkedList: 2->4->6->7->5->1
Output: 0


Solution :

def isCircular(head):
    if head==None:
        return True
    if head.next==head:
        return True
    temp=head  
    while temp.next!=head and temp.next!=None:
        temp=temp.next
    if temp.next==head:
        return True
    return False
