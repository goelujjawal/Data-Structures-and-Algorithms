Problem :

Given a linked list consisting of L nodes and given a number N. The task is to find the Nth node from the end of the linked list.

Example 1:
Input:
N = 2
LinkedList: 1->2->3->4->5->6->7->8->9
Output: 8
Explanation: In the first example, there are 9 nodes in linked list and we need to find 2nd node from end. 2nd node from end os 8.  

Example 2:
Input:
N = 5
LinkedList: 10->5->100->5
Output: -1
Explanation: In the second example, there are 4 nodes in the linked list and we need to find 5th from the end. 
Since 'n' is more than the number of nodes in the linked list, the output is -1.


Solution :

def rev(head):
    prev=None
    curr=head
    while curr!=None:
        forward=curr.next
        curr.next=prev
        prev=curr
        curr=forward
    return prev

def getNthFromLast(head,n):
    head=rev(head)
    temp=head
    c=1
    while n>c:
        if temp.next==None:
            return -1
        temp=temp.next
        c+=1
    return temp.data
